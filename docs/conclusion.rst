Conclusion
===========

This new model is intended to complement existing cybersecurity frameworks and maturity models by focusing on the degree to which threat information is optimally leveraged in 
an organizationâ€™s defenses. It outlines key components of cybersecurity likely to benefit most from leveraging threat information, along with defined levels of incorporation 
of that knowledge for each. This model should be considered a hypothesis of what constitutes an effective threat-informed defense to be revised and improved as evidence is 
gathered through its use.
