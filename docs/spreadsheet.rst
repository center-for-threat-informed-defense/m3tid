Appendix B - Scoring Spreadsheet
================================

As part of the M3TID project, the team implemented the Dimensions, Components, and Maturity Level framework, as well as the

* CTI: Definitions of CTI Components and Levels, and CTI maturity scoring.

* T&E: Definitions of T&E Components and Levels, and T&E maturity scoring.
* Results: Tab that calculates the organization's Dimension-level and Overall scores.
* Example Historical Change: Example tab provided to show how to track change over time. This tab does not automatically pull data from any other tab.
