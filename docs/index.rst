Background
-----------

Globally, security practitioners, security program leaders, and Board members seek to answer the question “Are we secure?” Our research adds a complementary approach to 
answering that question, to be combined with traditional cybersecurity best practices and maturity models. This is a starting point for building an effective Threat-Informed 
Defense that enables a data-driven approach to optimizing investments.  

The Center for Threat-Informed Defense (the Center) contends that one of the most impactful ways to manage a security program is to leverage knowledge of cyber threats to 
prioritize the allocation of limited resources to reduce overall risk. As risk is the product of probability and impact, it is crucially important to have a thorough knowledge 
of actual threat actors, their capabilities, and their typical tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). By understanding the adversary well, an organization can prioritize 
their defenses as well as pre-emptively and continuously assess themselves to identify gaps. This enables organizations to shift to a more proactive approach to security, 
constantly learning, assessing, and improving their security programs. The goal of this shift is to increase the cost and difficulty for the adversaries.  


The M3TID Project
-----------------

The Measure, Maximize, Mature Threat-Informed Defense (M3TID) project extends this concept of leveraging Threat understanding to improve a security program by working towards 
an actionable definition of Threat-Informed Defense and its associated key activities. The M3TID project is based on the hypothesis that applying Threat-Informed Defense will 
improve the efficiency of a security program and reduce organizational risk. The project captures insights and best practices for what it means to be Threat-Informed across a 
Security Program, expanding the Dimensions of Threat-Informed Defense into key components that organizations should implement. For each of these components, the M3TID project 
will define discrete levels reflecting implementations of that component from least-to-most threat-informed. 

The intent of the M3TID project is that organizations, from security practitioners to executive leaders, will be able to leverage this measurement framework to better assess 
and understand their current position in terms of a Threat-Informed Defense security program. With this model, the Center can develop a Roadmap to guide key next steps or 
investments to help organizations improve their level of Threat-Informed Defense. With this first framework for measuring the degree to which threat information is guiding 
security practices, the Center can start to gather the data needed to refine the model to reflect the relative importance of each of these components in contributing to 
bottom-line cyber risk reduction.
