Cyber Threat Intelligence
=========================

This section outlines the components that have been identified for the CTI dimension
as well as the levels within the components. These components and levels form the
basis for assessing how threat informed an organizationâ€™s CTI program is.

Depth of Threat Intelligence
----------------------------

What level of information (roughly relative to the Pyramid of Pain) is being used to
track adversaries?

1. Ephemeral IOCs: hashes, IPs, domains: data sources an adversary can change easily
2. Tools used by adversaries which can be swapped or
   modified by an adversary to evade detection
3. Techniques and Tactics used by adversaries which are harder to change
4. Low-variance adversary behaviors and associated observables which are very difficult to change

Breadth of Threat Intelligence
-----------------------------

Relative to the depth component, roughly how many ATT&CK techniques are understood at that level of depth? 

1. IOCs
2. Some techniques
3. Techniques targeted to your industry, region, or infrastructure
4. Prioritized targeted techniques

Relevance of Threat Intelligence
------------------------

How much does the threat information relate to your organization? 

1. Generic or freely available reporting
2. Industry-specific reporting (perhaps subscription)
3. Reports are created by in-house CTI team
4. Customized briefings from external groups

Utilization of Threat Intelligence
---------------------------------

How well does your organization make use of the threat information?

1. Occasionally read
2. Regularly ingested for analysis
3. Contextualized for internal stakeholders outside of security team
4. Analyzed automatically

Dissemination of Threat Reporting
---------------------------------

What threat information is passed along within an organization?

1. Tactical reporting with highly perishable information (IOCs)
2. Tactical reporting focused on adversary behavior (TTPs)
3. Operational-level reporting of pertinent campaigns
4. Strategic-level reporting of business risk
