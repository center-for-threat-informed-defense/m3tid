# Measure, Maximize, and Mature Threat-Informed Defense

The Measure, Maximize, and Mature Threat-Informed Defense (M3TID) project defines what
Threat-Informed Defense is and the key activities associated with its practice. The
project captures insights and best practices for what it means to be threat-informed
across a security program, expanding the dimensions of Threat-Informed Defense into key
components that organizations can implement. For each of these components, the project
defines specific elements of implementation maturity, which enables organizations to
assess and to understand the current and future state of their threat-informed defense
program.
